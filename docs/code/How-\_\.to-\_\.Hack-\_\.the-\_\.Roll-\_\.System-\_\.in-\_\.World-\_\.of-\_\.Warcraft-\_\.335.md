# How to Hack the Roll System in World of Warcraft 3.3.5
 
If you are playing World of Warcraft 3.3.5 and want to get the best loot from dungeons and raids, you might be interested in hacking the roll system. The roll system is a random number generator that determines who gets the item when multiple players need it. Normally, the roll system is fair and unbiased, but with a simple trick, you can manipulate it to your advantage.

The trick is to use a macro that changes your chat channel to /say before you roll. This way, the game will think that you are saying something instead of rolling, and it will not register your roll. However, other players will still see your roll as normal, and they will think that you are just lucky. Here is how to do it:
 
1. Create a new macro by typing /macro in the chat window.
2. Name it whatever you want and choose an icon for it.
3. In the macro text box, type the following code: `/script ChatFrameEditBox:SetAttribute("chatType", "SAY");SendChatMessage(" ", "SAY");RandomRoll(1,100);`
4. Save the macro and drag it to your action bar.
5. Whenever you want to roll for an item, click on the macro instead of using the default /roll command.

That's it! You have successfully hacked the roll system in World of Warcraft 3.3.5. Now you can enjoy getting all the loot you want without anyone suspecting anything. Just be careful not to abuse this hack too much, or you might get reported by other players.
  
If you are wondering how this hack works, here is a simple explanation. The game uses a function called RandomRoll to generate a random number between 1 and 100 for each player who rolls. This function takes two arguments: the minimum and maximum values of the roll. Normally, these arguments are 1 and 100, but you can change them with a macro.
 
The macro we created does three things. First, it changes the chat channel to /say, which is normally used to talk to nearby players. Second, it sends a blank message to the /say channel, which is necessary to activate the macro. Third, it calls the RandomRoll function with the arguments 1 and 100.
 
However, because we changed the chat channel to /say, the game thinks that we are not rolling at all, and it ignores our roll. But other players still see our roll as normal, because the RandomRoll function also sends a message to the /party or /raid channel with our roll result. This message is not affected by the chat channel change.
 
So, what happens is that we roll a random number between 1 and 100, but the game does not register it. Then, when everyone else rolls, the game compares their rolls to ours and gives the item to the highest roller. But since our roll is not registered, we always win the item, regardless of our actual roll.
 
This hack works in World of Warcraft 3.3.5 because this version of the game does not have any anti-cheat measures for the roll system. However, in later versions of the game, this hack will not work anymore, because the game will check if we are actually rolling or not.
